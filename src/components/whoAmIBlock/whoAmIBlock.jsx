                    Hi, I'm Gustavo. I am a software developer who lives in Rio de Janeiro. When I lived in Petr√≥polis, a city close to Rio, 
                    I had the opportunity to study and start working with computational tasks and I loved it.

                <div className="who-am-i-text">
                    Since I started working with this, I try to study and improve myself to become a better professional. And I hope that 
                    one day I will be a reference for people who worked with me, just as I had some people as a reference in my career.
